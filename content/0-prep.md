We invite authors to submite unpublished papers (2-4 pages maximum excluding references) to our workshop, to be presented at a workshop session upon acceptance. Submissions will undergo a peer-review process by the workshop's program committee. 

More information about submission instructions, presentation format, and important dates will be announced soon.
