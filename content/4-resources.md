**Koji Inoue**
Assistant Professor, Kyoto University, Japan. Koji Inoue received his Ph.D. from Kyoto University in 2018 and is an expert in conversational AI and social robotics. His team developed advanced dialogue systems (e.g., the Android ERICA) that integrate multimodal backchannels. In 2023, he was a visiting researcher at KTH in Sweden. He has received international awards (e.g., NETEXPLO Innovation Award 2022) and brings expertise in human–robot interaction and group communication dynamics.
